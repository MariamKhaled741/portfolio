  <p>
    I’m a developer with a passion for building clean, accessible, and user-focused digital experiences that merge front-end development with data-driven insights. With a background in both web development and data science, I enjoy working on projects that bring together design, usability, and smart analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I’m a third-year Computer and Data Science student at Alexandria University. I’ve completed projects involving machine learning, classification, and regression, as well as a full-stack file sharing web app hosted on AWS. I also have experience with tools like Python, SQL, Excel, and libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my learning journey, I’ve taken courses on platforms like DataCamp and explored areas including clustering, SVMs, neural networks, and cloud computing. I’m particularly drawn to the intersection between data science and front-end development—where insights meet interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies, improving my design skills with HTML/CSS, and brainstorming ways to make complex information more usable and beautiful through code.
